# Defeat-Cancer-with-CNNs
In the coming years, artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize the field of medicine with its transformative effects. Our project focuses on the role of AI in medical diagnosis, specifically, the detection of Breast Cancer using deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the highly advanced ResNet-32 neural network architecture renowned for its exceptional performance.

## Project Overview
Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, we have developed a robust model for breast cancer detection. Our model employs a series of convolutional layers, pooling, and dropout to identify intricate features in medical images. Additionally, we've harnessed the power of ResNet-32.
The project involves binary classification, predicting the presence or absence of breast cancer.
